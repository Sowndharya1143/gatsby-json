    "subtitle":"What is a donor-advised fund?",
    "subdescription":"A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable giving account designed exclusively to invest, grow, and give assets to charities for meaningful and lasting impact. Here's how it works: You donate assets into a DAF and recommend how those assets should be invested. Your contribution is tax-deductible and the assets in the DAF grow tax-free. When you're ready, recommend a grant to a charity you care about, and we take care of the rest. Some people call it a giving vehicle. Others call it a philanthropic fund. We call it the most convenient, tax-efficient way to give back.",
